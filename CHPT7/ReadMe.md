## Tables

__Table 7.1__ – Differential gene expression analysis for _Marinobacter_ sp. FDB33 using DESEQ2 (Love et al., 2014), indicated are Log2foldchanges for all comparisons. For example, N33 (treatment) versus F33 (control). Time point is indicated by TP1 or TP2.

__Table 7.2__ – Differential gene expression analysis for _Alteromonas_ sp. FDB36 using DESEQ2 (Love et al., 2014), indicated are Log2foldchanges for all comparisons. For example, N36 (treatment) versus F36 (control). Time point is indicated by TP1 or TP2.

__Table 7.3__ – Differential gene expression analysis for _Nannochloropsis oceanica_ CCAP849/10 using DESEQ2 (Love et al., 2014), indicated are Log2foldchanges for all comparisons. For example, N33 (treatment) versus NAX (control). Time point is indicated by TP1 or TP2.
