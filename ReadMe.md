__Chapter 4__ – List of complete genome sequences used in Chapter 5. Gammaproteobacteria as well as a Alphaproteobacterial outgroup containing Rhodobacter, Roseobacter, Rugegeria, Dinoroseobacter and Pheobacter strains.

__Chapter 5__ - Genome statistics for genomes used in Chapter 5, as derived from CheckM (Parks et al., 2015). 

__Chapter 6__ – Phenotypic data derived from IJSEM (Barberán et al., 2017). 

__Chapter 7__ - Marinobacter signature orthologs. Pan-genome was calculated for Oceanospirilalles genomes as well as members of the Marinobacter genus. Shown are orthologous gene families which are shared among all Marinobacter genomes but absent in all Oceanospirilalles genomes. Indicated are locus tags from Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus SP17.
