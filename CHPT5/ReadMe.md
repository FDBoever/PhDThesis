# Online Supporting Material for Chapter 5
>Pangenome and phylogenomic relationship of _Marinobacter_ and related Gammaproteobacteria: proposal  to transfer _Marinobacter  gen. nov._ from _Alteromonadales ord. nov._ to _Oceanospirillales ord. nov._ within the new family _Marinobacteraceae fam. nov._

## Tables

__Table 5.1__ – List of complete genome sequences used in Chapter 5. Gammaproteobacteria as well as a Alphaproteobacterial outgroup containing Rhodobacter, Roseobacter, Rugegeria, Dinoroseobacter and Pheobacter strains.

__Table 5.2__ - Genome statistics for genomes used in Chapter 5, as derived from CheckM (Parks et al., 2015). 

__Table 5.3__ – Phenotypic data derived from IJSEM (Barberán et al., 2017). 

__Table 5.4__ - Marinobacter signature orthologs. Pan-genome was calculated for Oceanospirilalles genomes as well as members of the Marinobacter genus. Shown are orthologous gene families which are shared among all Marinobacter genomes but absent in all Oceanospirilalles genomes. Indicated are locus tags from Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus SP17.
