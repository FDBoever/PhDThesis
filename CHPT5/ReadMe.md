# Online Supporting Material for Chapter 5
>Pangenome and phylogenomic relationship of _Marinobacter_ and related _Gammaproteobacteria_: proposal  to transfer _Marinobacter_  gen. nov. from _Alteromonadales_ ord. nov. to _Oceanospirillales_ ord. nov. within the new family _Marinobacteraceae_ fam. nov.

## Tables

__Table 5.1__ – List of complete genome sequences used in Chapter 5. _Gammaproteobacteria_ as well as a _Alphaproteobacterial_ outgroup containing _Rhodobacter_, _Roseobacter_, _Rugegeria_, _Dinoroseobacter_ and _Pheobacter_ strains.

__Table 5.2__ - Genome statistics for genomes used in Chapter 5, as derived from CheckM (Parks et al., 2015). 

__Table 5.3__ – Phenotypic data derived from IJSEM (Barberán et al., 2017). 

__Table 5.4__ - _Marinobacter_ signature orthologs. Pan-genome was calculated for _Oceanospirilalles_ genomes as well as members of the _Marinobacter_ genus. Shown are orthologous gene families which are shared among all _Marinobacter_ genomes but absent in all _Oceanospirilalles_ genomes. Indicated are locus tags from _Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus_ SP17.
